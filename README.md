Users can post questions. Other users can answer them.
Users can comment on both questions and answers. Like StackOverflow, the comments should just be displayed in a flat list.
The user who posted a question can declare one of the user-submitted answers to be the best answer.
Users can upvote and downvote questions, answers, and comments—only one vote per user for each question, answer, and comment.
Users cannot add a question, answer, or comment or vote unless they're logged in, but they can view all of the above when logged out.
Stretch: Sort answers with the answer selected as the best answer first, followed by the most highly voted. Sort comments chronologically with oldest first.
Stretch: Users can see questions sorted three ways: highest-voted, most recent, and "trending".
